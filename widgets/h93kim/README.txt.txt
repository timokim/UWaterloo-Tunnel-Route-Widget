It is a widget that shows, on a Google map, the route between any two of the buildings on campus which, by default, is the one with as little exposure to sunlight (i.e. indoor paths) as possible. There is also an outdoor option as well as a weather-dependent option which fetches the current weather information and, in harsh weather conditions such as strong wind, rain, snow, or subzero temperature, suggests the indoor route. Otherwise, it gives the outdoor path.

The interaction is pretty much well laid out in the proposal and, even without that, I feel the widget's functionality is extremely intuitive that no real explanation is needed.

One thing, underneath what's visible in the widget, I'd like to note is the amount of time(and the resulting code) that this assignment took for me to map out the indoor routes. Since there is no API of lat/lng points of all the tunnels between the buildings, I created them, as is documented in the javascript comment. Then, I used graph theory: Depth-first search algorithm to map out the route between buildings. Some of the indoor routes is not obviously the ideal because the calculation of the route is simply measured with respect to the number of tunnels(or connections between buildings) one has to pass through. Even then, it is pretty neat to see all the different paths it recommends between buildings using the various tunnels. (Also needed to mention is that for buildings which are not connected, such as DP or Needles Hall or from math/science/engineering buildings to arts/environment buildings, I simply made the shortest route between those buildings, treating them as if they're tunnels.
